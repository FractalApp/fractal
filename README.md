#  Fractal App

0.0.1 alpha

ðŸ”¥ Make Javascript and WebGL prototypes with ease, without thinking about webpack, babel, folder structure etc.

Fractal is tough to work principally with the canvas, to unleash your imagination, but it can be useful also to test algorithms, and whatever you like.

#### How to use:
- **Tabs:**  Every file you can edit is a tab. The tab with a point on the left is the main entry ( the first file that will be executed )
- **Libraries:** Javascript libraries that will be added to the html document as a script tag
- **Resources:** The files that you need to use, such as images. You can find them under the "/resources" path -> "/resources/yourimage.png"

#### Notes: 
- You can use import, export, require
- Webpack specific reatures are not supported, like require.ensure

#### Supported tab extensions:
- .js -> transpiled with babel
- .json -> you can require a json tab and use it as a Javascript Object
- .raw | glsl | frag | vert | txt -> loaded as raw text
