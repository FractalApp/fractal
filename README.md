0.0.1 alpha

Fractal is a macOS app that will help you make Javascript WebGL/canvas prototypes and share them without thinking about all the tools around the modern frontend workflow, just open the app and start to code.

There are 4 templates available right now, you can choose one of them, or create a blank project.

**Templates:**
- Pixi.js
- p5.js
- Three.js
- Babylon.js

Fractal is tough to work principally with the canvas, to unleash your imagination, but it can be useful also to test algorithms, and whatever you like.

#### How to use:
- Open the app
- Choose a template
- Unleash your imagination

#### Notes:
- **Tabs:** Every file you can edit is a tab. The tab with a point on the left is the main entry ( the first file that will be executed )
- **Libraries:** Javascript libraries that will be added to the html document as a script tag
- **Resources:** The files that you need to use, such as images. You can find them under the "/resources" path -> "/resources/yourimage.png"
- You can use import, export, require
- Webpack specific reatures are not supported, like require.ensure

#### Supported tab extensions:
- .js -> transpiled with babel
- .json -> you can require a json tab and use it as a Javascript Object
- .raw | glsl | frag | vert | txt -> loaded as raw text

### Requirements:
macOS 10.13 or later
